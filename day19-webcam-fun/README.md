# Webcam Fun – JavaScript30 Day 19

## About  
This project is part of the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) challenge by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos).  
It demonstrates how to access the **user’s webcam**, display a **live video feed**, draw it to a **canvas element**, and capture **photos** from the live stream.

## What I Learned  
- How to use the **MediaDevices API** (`navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`) to access webcam streams.
- How to **stream video to a `<video>` element** using `srcObject`.
- Drawing the video feed to a `<canvas>` using `canvas.getContext('2d')` and `drawImage`.
- Capturing a still image from the canvas using `canvas.toDataURL()` and creating a downloadable photo.
- Using audio feedback with `<audio>` when taking a snapshot.
- Creating and inserting elements dynamically into the DOM.
