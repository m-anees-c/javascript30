# Shadow On Mouse Move – JavaScript30 Day 16

## About  
This project is part of the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) challenge by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos).  
It creates a dynamic **text shadow effect** that follows the user’s mouse movement across a container. As the user moves the mouse, the shadow of the text updates in real time, creating a 3D-like effect.

## What I Learned
- How to use **`mousemove` events** to track cursor position relative to an element.
- Handling nested element mouse positions with **`offsetX`**, **`offsetY`**, **`offsetWidth`** and **`offsetHeight`**.
