# Follow Along Link Highlighter â€“ JavaScript30 Day 22

## About  
This project is part of the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) challenge by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos).  
It showcases how to create a **dynamic link highlight effect** that follows the user's cursor as they hover over links. The effect is achieved using **JavaScript DOM manipulation** and **CSS transitions**.

## What I Learned
- How to dynamically create and position a **highlight element** based on the position and size of anchor tags.
- Use of **`getBoundingClientRect()`** to retrieve precise coordinates of DOM elements.
