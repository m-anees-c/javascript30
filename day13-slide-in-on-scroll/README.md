# Slide In on Scroll â€“ JavaScript30 Day 13

## About  
This project is part of the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) challenge by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos).  
It adds a smooth **slide-in animation effect** to images when they enter the viewport during scrolling. 

## What I Learned  
- Detecting when an image is **half-visible** on the screen using `window.scrollY`, `offsetTop`, and `innerHeight`.
- Dynamically adding and removing the `.active` class to trigger **CSS animations**.
