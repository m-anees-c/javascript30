# Sticky Nav – JavaScript30 Day 24

## About  
This project is part of the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) challenge by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos).  
It demonstrates how to create a **sticky navigation bar** using JavaScript. When the user scrolls past the navbar, it becomes fixed at the top of the screen while adjusting for layout shift by applying padding dynamically.

## What I Learned
- How to use `offsetTop` to determine an element’s position relative to the top of the document.
- How to use `scrollY` to track the vertical scroll position.
- How to dynamically add or remove CSS classes based on scroll position.
- How to prevent layout shift when applying `position: fixed` by setting `paddingTop` on the body equal to the nav height.
