# Flex Panels Gallery â€“ JavaScript30 Day 5

## About
This project creates an interactive flexbox-based image gallery. Each panel expands when clicked, revealing emphasized middle text and sliding in/out surrounding text. It focuses on combining CSS Flexbox layout, transitions, and JavaScript to control class toggling and animation timing. Built as part of the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) challenge by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos).

## Features
- Full-width horizontal flex container with responsive panels
- Click to expand a panel (only one open at a time)
- Smooth animated growth using flex and font-size transitions
- Text slide-in/out effect triggered after flex transition ends


## What I Learned
- Using Flexbox growth (`flex` values) for interactive layouts
- Listening to `click` and `transitionend` events
