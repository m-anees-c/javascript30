# Click and Drag to Scroll â€“ JavaScript30 Day 27

## About  
This project is part of the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) challenge by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos).  
It demonstrates how to create a **click-and-drag scrolling effect** for a horizontal list of items, similar to what you see in image galleries or sliders. Instead of using scrollbars, users can hold the mouse button and drag to navigate.
