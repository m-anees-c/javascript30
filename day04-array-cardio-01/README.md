# Array Cardio 01 – JavaScript30 Day 4

## About
This project is part of the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) challenge by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos).

It demonstrates powerful JavaScript **Array methods**—`filter()`, `map()`, `sort()`, and `reduce()`—to manipulate and process data effectively.  
Beyond the original console-only exercise, this version includes an **interactive UI** where users can trigger each operation and instantly view the results.

## Features
- Interactive buttons to run the following array operations:
  - `filter()`
  - `map()`
  - `sort()`
  - `reduce()`
- Dynamic result area that can:
  - Display tables for object-based results
  - Show formatted text for aggregated or list-based outputs

## What I Learned
- Applying `filter`, `map`, `sort`, and `reduce` on object arrays
- Dynamically rendering HTML tables from JavaScript arrays

## Dataset
The **inventors** array:
```js
{ first: String, last: String, year: Number, passed: Number }
```
The **data** array (for counting instances):
```
['car','car','truck','truck','bike','walk', ... ]
```
