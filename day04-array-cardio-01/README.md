# Array Cardio 01 â€“ JavaScript30 Day 4

## About
This project is part of the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) challenge by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos).  
It demonstrates powerful JavaScript **Array methods** such as `filter()`, `map()`, `sort()`, and `reduce()` to manipulate and process data effectively.

## What I Learned
- How to use `filter()` to extract specific data from an array
- How `map()` transforms data into a new structure
- Different ways to use `sort()` for custom sorting logic
- How to calculate aggregate values with `reduce()`
