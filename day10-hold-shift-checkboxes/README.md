# Hold Shift to Check Multiple Checkboxes â€“ JavaScript30 Day 10

## About
This project is part of the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) challenge by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos).  
It replicates a feature commonly seen in email clients: **clicking one checkbox, holding Shift, and clicking another checkbox will select all checkboxes in between**. It demonstrates DOM event handling and user interaction without any libraries.

## What I Learned
- Handling multiple checkbox selections with plain JavaScript.
- Using the `Shift` key with `e.shiftKey` during event handling.
- Querying and iterating over DOM elements with `querySelectorAll()` and `forEach()`.
