# Clock â€“ JavaScript30 Day 2

## About  
This project is an advanced **analog + digital clock** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.  
It displays both an analog clock with hour, minute, and second hands, and a live digital clock below it.  
Now enhanced with **time zone search and selection**, allowing users to view the current time in any supported time zone.  
This project is part of the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) challenge by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos), focused on building real-world JavaScript projects without using frameworks or libraries.

## Features

- Smooth-moving analog clock hands  
- Live digital clock display  
- Search and select from all supported time zones  
- Persistent selected time zone using `localStorage`  
- Uses **Intl.DateTimeFormat** for accurate time calculations

## What I Learned

- Handling `Date` and time zones with `Intl.DateTimeFormat`  
- Creating a dynamic search feature for time zones  
- Updating DOM  
- Managing user preferences with `localStorage`
