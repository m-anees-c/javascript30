# Clock â€“ JavaScript30 Day 2

## About  
This project is a fully functional analog and digital clock built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.  
It displays both a moving analog clock with hour, minute, and second hands, and a live digital time display below it.  
The project is part of the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) challenge by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos), focused on building real-world JavaScript projects without using frameworks or libraries.

## Features

- Smooth-moving analog clock hands  
- Live digital clock display  
- Uses native JavaScript `Date` and DOM manipulation

## What I Learned

- Working with `Date` objects in JavaScript  
- Updating DOM elements on an interval using `setInterval`
