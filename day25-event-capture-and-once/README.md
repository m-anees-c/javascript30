# Event Capture, Propagation, Bubbling, and Once â€“ JavaScript30 Day 25

## About  
This project is part of the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) challenge by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos).  
It demonstrates how **event capturing**, **event bubbling**, and the `once` option in `addEventListener()` work in JavaScript. By clicking on nested `<div>` elements, you can observe how events propagate through the DOM. Additionally, a button is configured to respond to a click **only once**, after which it will not trigger the event handler again.
