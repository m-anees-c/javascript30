# Whack-A-Mole – JavaScript30 Day 30

## About  
This project is part of the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) challenge by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos).  
It’s a **fun interactive game** where moles randomly pop out of holes, and the player needs to **click (whack) them** as quickly as possible to score points. The moles appear for random durations and in random holes, keeping the gameplay unpredictable and challenging.
