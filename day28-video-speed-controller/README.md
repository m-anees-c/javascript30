# Video Speed Controller â€“ JavaScript30 Day 28

## About  
This project is part of the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) challenge by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos).  
It implements a **video playback speed control** feature using a vertical scrubber bar. By moving the mouse up and down over the scrubber, users can dynamically adjust the playback speed of a video in real time.
