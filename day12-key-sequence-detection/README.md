# Key Sequence Detection – JavaScript30 Day 12

## About  
This project is part of the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) challenge by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos).  
It introduces the concept of **key sequence detection** — when a specific combination of keys is pressed, a secret animation is triggered. In this project, typing `← ↑ ↓ →` activates a cool **race car animation**.

## What I Learned  
- Listening for and handling `keyup` events in JavaScript.
- Managing a **array** of recent key presses to detect a specific sequence.
- Comparing arrays by converting them to strings.
