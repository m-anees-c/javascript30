# Sort Without Articles â€“ JavaScript30 Day 17

## About  
This project is part of the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) challenge by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos).  
It demonstrates how to sort a list of band names **alphabetically**, while **ignoring leading articles** like `a`, `an`, and `the`.

## What I Learned
- How to use **regular expressions** to strip articles (`a`, `an`, `the`) from strings.
- Custom sorting with **`Array.prototype.sort()`**.
- String comparison using the **ternary operator** for concise logic.
- DOM manipulation to render sorted elements dynamically.
