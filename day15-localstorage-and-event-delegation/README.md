# LocalStorage and Event Delegation â€“ JavaScript30 Day 15

## About  
This project is part of the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) challenge by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos).  
It demonstrates how to build a simple **to-do list app** using JavaScript. It utilizes **localStorage** to persist data across sessions and leverages **event delegation** for efficiently handling click events on dynamically created checkboxes.

## What I Learned
- How to **read from and write to `localStorage`** using `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()`.
- How to use **event delegation** to manage click events on a list of checkboxes.
- How to create and update DOM elements dynamically using `innerHTML` and template literals.
- Working with **form submissions**, **checkbox inputs**, and using the `reset()` method to clear a form.
