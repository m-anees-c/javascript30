# Drum Kit – JavaScript30 Day 1

## About  
This is a simple, interactive drum kit web page as part of the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) challenge by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos).  
It allows users to play different drum sounds by pressing keys or clicking on the drum pads.  
The goal of this project is to practice event handling and working with audio in vanilla JavaScript — without using any libraries or frameworks.

## Features

- Keyboard and mouse interaction  
- Smooth key animations on press  
- Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only

## What I Learned

- Handling keyboard and mouse events with JavaScript  
- Selecting and playing audio elements dynamically  
- Using transitions and removing animation classes
