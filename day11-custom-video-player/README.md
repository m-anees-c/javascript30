# Custom Video Player â€“ JavaScript30 Day 11

## About  
This project is part of the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) challenge by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos).  
It involves building a **custom video player** using just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## What I Learned
- Accessing and controlling video playback using the HTML5 `<video>` element API.
- Implementing play/pause toggles with `video.play()` and `video.pause()`.
- Handling events like `play`, `pause`, and `timeupdate` for interactivity.
- Syncing a visual progress bar using JavaScript and CSS.
- Scrubbing through video using mouse events (`click`, `mousemove`, `mousedown`, `mouseup`).
- Dynamically updating playback rate and volume with input sliders.
- Using `dataset.skip` to add skip-forward and skip-back buttons.
