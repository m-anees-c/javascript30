# Stripe Follow Along Nav – JavaScript30 Day 26

## About  
This project is part of the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) challenge by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos).  
It recreates a **Stripe-style navigation menu** with smooth dropdown animations. When hovering over a menu item, the corresponding dropdown is revealed, and a background element animates to match the dropdown's size and position.

## What I Learned
- How to handle **mouseenter** and **mouseleave** events for hover interactions.
- Using **`setTimeout`** with conditional checks to create smooth, delayed animations.
- How to use **`getBoundingClientRect()`** to calculate an element’s size and position on the page.
